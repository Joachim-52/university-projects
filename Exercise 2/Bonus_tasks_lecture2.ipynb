    "The following tasks are designed to help you practice the contents of the lecture. \n",
    "We strongly encourage you to solve these tasks **before** the next in-person session on Wednesday, as you can receive **up to 3 bonus points** if you present your solution(s) there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to get bonus points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve as many of the following tasks as possible.\n",
    "2. Attend the next in-person session on Wednesday.\n",
    "3. Raise your hands and volunteer to present your solution to one task.\n",
    "4. If more than one students volunteer to present a solution to a task, one student will be selected at random.\n",
    "5. The selected student will now present the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide a laptop which is connected to a projector that already has this file opened. \n",
    "You should write your solution in the appropriate cell and explain what your code does. \n",
    "Of course, you can also bring a \"cheat sheet\" or your laptop to look up your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This is **not** an examination, which means you can only earn (bonus) points. \n",
    "You cannot lose points or anything like that if you cannot explain your code or make a mistake.\n",
    "The goal of these in-person sessions is that you practice the lecture content as early as possible and get rewarded for it.\n",
    "Also, by presenting your solutions, you will get immediate feedback on your code/solutions, which should help you learn Python :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules & Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that all the tasks add up to 8 bonus points. However, you can only earn **up to 3 bonus points per in-person session**. Even if you present more than two tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some additional restrictions on how bonus points can improve your grade in this course:\n",
    "First, it is not possible to earn more than the maximum points for the practical part of the course (i.e., 85 P). For example, if a student achieves 84 points plus 5 bonus points, the total score is still 85 points). Second, bonus points are only considered if at least 50 non-bonus points are achieved in the entire course (i.e., bonus points cannot be used to achieve a positive grade)."
