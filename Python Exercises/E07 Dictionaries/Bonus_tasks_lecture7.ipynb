    "## Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tasks are designed to help you practice the contents of the lecture. \n",
    "We strongly encourage you to solve these tasks **before** the next in-person session, as you can receive **up to 3 bonus points** if you present your solution(s) there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to get bonus points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve as many of the following tasks as possible.\n",
    "2. Attend the next in-person session.\n",
    "3. Raise your hands and volunteer to present your solution to one task.\n",
    "4. If more than one students volunteer to present a solution to a task, one student will be selected at random.\n",
    "5. The selected student will now present the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can bring your own laptop to the front to present the solution. If you don't have a laptop please bring a storage device or paper with your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This is **not** an examination, which means you can only earn (bonus) points. \n",
    "You cannot lose points or anything like that if you cannot explain your code or make a mistake.\n",
    "The goal of these in-person sessions is that you practice the lecture content as early as possible and get rewarded for it.\n",
    "Also, by presenting your solutions, you will get immediate feedback on your code/solutions, which should help you learn Python :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules & Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can only earn **up to 3 bonus points per in-person session**. Even if you present more than two tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some additional restrictions on how bonus points can improve your grade in this course:\n",
    "First, it is not possible to earn more than the maximum points for the practical part of the course (i.e., 85 P). For example, if a student achieves 84 points plus 5 bonus points, the total score is still 85 points). Second, bonus points are only considered if at least 50 non-bonus points are achieved in the entire course (i.e., bonus points cannot be used to achieve a positive grade).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your solutions **MUST NOT be hardcoded**. They have to work with any suitable data provided!\n",
    "\n",
    "Also make sure to be able to explain your implementations in detail!"
